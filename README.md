# C_code_forces
Programs solving various algorithmic problems

## **How to Compile and Run**  
All programs are standard C and can be compiled with `gcc`:  
```bash
gcc filename.c -o output  
./output
```
## Program Breakdown

1. watermelon.c
   
Determines if a watermelon of given weight can be divided into two parts where both parts have even weights.
```
Even number divisibility checker
Practical Use:
1. Food packaging systems ensuring equal portion weights
2. Resource allocation problems requiring balanced even distributions
3. Mathematical puzzles and educational programming exercises
```

2. trippi_troppi.c
   
Creates abbreviations by extracting the first letter of each word from multiple input strings.
```
String abbreviation generator
Practical Use:
1. Creating acronyms from organization or project names
2. Generating short codes for inventory or product categorization
3. Educational tools for teaching string manipulation and abbreviation concepts
```
3. treasure_hunt.c
   
Simulates a treasure hunting game where two players (Sam and Tom) take turns digging, determining who finds the treasure based on digging depths and cycles.
```
Turn-based game simulation with cyclic logic
Practical Use:
1. Board game mechanics for alternating player turns
2. Task scheduling systems with rotating responsibilities
3. Resource access patterns in multi-user systems with time-based allocation
```
4. sum.c
   
Calculates the sum of digits for two-digit numbers.
```
Digit sum calculator for two-digit numbers
Practical Use:
1. Checksum validation systems for numeric identifiers
2. Mathematical educational tools for digit manipulation exercises
3. Simple hash functions or numeric fingerprinting applications
```
